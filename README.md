#### [Docker Bangalore Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/)

With around 8100+ community member, Docker Bangalore Meetup group is one of the largest Docker meetup group in India.

With a motto of "Learn, Collaborate & Dockerize!" you get chance to meet other developers and ops engineers in your community that are using and learning about Docker. Docker is an open platform that helps you build, ship and run applications anytime and anywhere. Developers use Docker to modify code and to streamline application development, while operations gain support to quickly and flexibly respond to their changing needs. Docker ensures agility, portability and control for all your distributed apps.

#### [Play with Docker Classroom](http://training.play-with-docker.com/)

Play with Docker (PWD) is a Docker playground which allows you to try Docker and Swarm Mode in a matter of seconds. It gives you the experience of having a free Alpine Linux Virtual Machine in the cloud where you can build and run Docker containers and even create clusters with Docker features like Swarm Mode. Under the hood DIND or Docker-in-Docker is used to give the effect of multiple VMs/PCs.

Here are some of the most common use-cases:

- Try new features fast as it’s updated with the latest dev versions.
- Set up clusters in no-time and launch replicated services.
- Learn through it’s interactive tutorials: training.play-with-docker.com.
- Give presentations at conferences and meetups.
- Allow to run advanced workshops that’d usually require complex setups
- Collaborate with community members to diagnose and detect issues.

The Play with Docker classroom brings you labs and tutorials that help you get hands-on experience using Docker. In this classroom you will find a mix labs and tutorials that will help Docker users, including SysAdmins, IT Pros, and Developers. There is a mix of hands-on tutorials right in the browser, instructions on setting up and using Docker in your own environment, and resources about best practices for developing and deploying your own applications.

If you want to contribute a lab, check out this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker.github.io/commit/59a33dcb38002ec58db8826e7396e00433f78816) and get started.

### [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com)

Play with Kubernetes is a labs site provided by Docker and created by Tutorius. Play with Kubernetes is a playground which allows users to run K8s clusters in a matter of seconds. It gives the experience of having a free Alpine Linux Virtual Machine in browser. Under the hood Docker-in-Docker (DinD) is used to give the effect of multiple VMs/PCs.

If you want to learn more about Kubernetes, consider the Play with Kubernetes Classroom which provides more directed learning using an integrated Play with Kubernetes commandline.
